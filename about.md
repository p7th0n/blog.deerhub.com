## The Pitch

- Do you have a group of hunters who share hunting stands?
- Do you want to keep track of your deer hunting?
- Do you have properties that are overrun with white-tail deer?

## Deerhub.com allows you to see at a glance who is hunting where and when in real-time.

- Who - members of your group.
- Where - properties that your group manages and stands on those properties.
- When - the days and time of day that your members reserve stands, register harvests or leave comments.

Your group can be hunting clubs, townships, parks, private property owners, outfitters and groups of family & friends who hunt together.

Use Deerhub.com from anywhere you have Internet access, there is nothing to install.  New features are available immediately without need to update.

- From your home PC or Mac
- From your smartphone (iPhones, Androids, Blackberries, etc.)

Plan group hunts or drives.  Invite members to meet and schedule the time and place.

You can connect with other groups on Deerhub.com and with other Deerhub.com members.
